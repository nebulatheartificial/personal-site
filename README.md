hi! im abhi and this is my personal website! :))

quick lore dump: i used to only make websites with template builders (rip godaddy drag-and-drop), and honestly… it worked. it got the job done. but recently i was like “ok i should probably learn how to ACTUALLY code this stuff,” so i dove into html + css and boom — here we are.

this is my first real hand-coded personal site. no templates. no builders. no cheating. just me, google, stackoverflow crying sessions, and vibes.

i’m still learning, so it’s kinda basic rn, but i’m gonna keep adding cool stuff as i level up — blogs, projects, random experiments, maybe even a secret page idk yet. basically whatever my brain decides at 2am.

anyway, thanks for checking it out! if you have feedback, pls send it (nicely pls i’m sensitive 💀).

enjoy :D
